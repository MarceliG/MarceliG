### Hi, everyone 🤝

- 🙋‍♂️ About me

  I am a Python programmer since 2019. I have a strong passion for solving complex problems and optimizing work. With a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and best practices, I strive to deliver high-quality solutions.
  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Receipt](https://github.com/MarceliG/Receipt)

  A project to recognize text from a photo. The goal is to create an application that, when you receive a photo/scan of a receipt/invoice, scans the text and saves it to a database. Analyzes the quantity, value, and type of products you buy. Ability to receive a report from a specific time period.
